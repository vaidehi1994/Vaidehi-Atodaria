I can do it too. This proves nothing. The use of ‘suspected’ could be replaced with ‘unproven’ and they could report the same story, but CBC isn’t about to bite the hand that feeds. 

I’m not going to disagree that kids died in these schools. I’m sure we have records of that. What I’m disagreeing with is some large cover up of mass graves by the government. Kids died in terrible conditions across any state/Church run facility at the time, be they orphanages or residential schools. 

So, why don’t they put some of the billions we waste on them to good use and start digging?

- Expelled a Canadian diplomat 

- Stopped new visas for Canadians 

- Indian hackers conducted cyber attacks on government websites. 

- India weeks letter tells Canada to remove 41 more diplomats. 

And so far the only response was expelling an Indian diplomat? 

Not sure what the government is waiting for. The results of the investigation will be one of two, either they did it or they didn’t.

•	⁠Expelled a Canadian diplomat

•	⁠Stopped new visas for Canadians

•	⁠Indian hackers conducted cyber attacks on government websites.

What would I do in this situation and why would I put it out publicly.

1. I am dead ass confident in the evidence. I would remain silent and let them continue to expel diplomats, suspend visas and retaliate however else they wanted to, short of harming people. I would than again publicly ask for support in the investigation (knowing full well they would refuse). Finally release the evidence publicly for all too see. At that point all of the retaliation from India looks like fear and weakness and in a way admission of guilt (why not cooperate in the first place if you had nothing to do with it).

2. The evidence has been shared with allies already and out of public view they are deciding what to do. Word got out about it and it was better to break the news then the media. But the response has not been decided.

k3fkruy,2023-10-04 14:25:01+00:00,ThreeKos,,"While noting the hysterical Indian bots on this issue, I am not one of them.  That said -

""FiVe EyEs"" is not what Canadians seem to think it is. It isn't a computer program that has lots of relianble intelligence. Its simply an intelligence sharing alliance. And it is practically a means where the US gets access to the other 4's for the purpose of anti-terrorism, and domestic media and opposition parties can't complain that private and confidential information is shared with a foreign state (the US).

The *alleged* intel is more aptly described.as ""from the  US"". It isn't given greater reliability by calling it ""from the Five Eyes"". 

The India bots are right on two points. One, what is the *allegation*? Because ""potentially credible evidence of a possible link"" is *very* broad. The Indian government sending a government agent hitman to Canada, and the Indian government knowing about but not preventing the assassination, are two very different things.  It is not an excuse that ""FiVe EyEs intelligence can't be made public"" which naive Canadians seem to think. The government can state the allegation then if it can't provide the evidence, because it hasn't even done that.

Second, it *should* provide the evidence of the link if Canada is going to make (some sort of) allegation of foreign assassination.  When the Russians had their spy murdered with polonium in the UK, and the Saudis murdered the journalist, both countries made the specific allegation, and the supporting evidence, public. It is confusing why further Indian ""cooperation"" would be necessary.

The Trudeau government is making an error here. Its either a) has some evidence but not enough, which makes it irresponsible: or b) has the evidence but is being poorly advised that it doesn't need to provide it, perhaps because it doesn't want to ""further damage"" relations.  This is of course incompetence because you have to go the distance when an allegation of this nature is made.

1. Trudeau accused India based on allegations and kicked out an Indian diplomat on same day.
2. Indian foreign minister's spokesperson strongly refused the allegations. Kicked out a Canadian diplomat.
3. Canada issued a travel-advisory on India
4. India issued a travel advisory on Canada
5. India banned issuing VISA for Canadians  <-- This is  key point
6. India asked for parity on number of diplomats on same day. A routine thing done by all countries to unfriendly countries.
7. Canada didn't respond
8. No country condemned India except Pakistan. Only US issued a statement saying ""We are concerned about serious allegations"".
9. India banned Canadians from applying visa through another country's embassy.
10. Canada didn't respond.
11. Canadian PM announces he is not looking to provoke India and wants to work with an important country.
12. One week later, India kicked out 41 of Canada's 62 diplomats. Asked them to leave by Oct10 so that now both countries will have parity of 21 diplomats each. All countries allow only equal number of diplomats, except as concession to friendly countries.
13. Canadian foreign minister requested for private talks. Says it would cause problems for canada if that many diplomats are removed.
14. Canadian PM requests for de-escalating.  <-- we are here now

In geopolitics, to an outside observer this will look like either Canada overplayed its hand or was caught making unsubstantiated allegations. Both looks weak and unstable.

It seems his card was to threaten India saying he won't issue VISA anymore to Indians. But, when Indian govt was the first to make that move and called his bluff, he was unable to recover after that.

This is what it looks like.

1. Trudeau accused India based on allegations and kicked out an Indian diplomat on same day.
2. Indian foreign minister's spokesperson strongly refused the allegations. Kicked out a Canadian diplomat.
3. Canada issued a travel-advisory on India
4. India issued a travel advisory on Canada
5. India banned issuing VISA for Canadians  <-- This is  key point
6. India asked for parity on number of diplomats on same day. A routine thing done by all countries to unfriendly countries.
7. Canada didn't respond
8. No country condemned India except Pakistan. Only US issued a statement saying ""We are concerned about serious allegations"".
9. India banned Canadians from applying visa through another country's embassy.
10. Canada didn't respond.
11. Canadian PM announces he is not looking to provoke India and wants to work with an important country.
12. One week later, India kicked out 41 of Canada's 62 diplomats. Asked them to leave by Oct10 so that now both countries will have parity of 21 diplomats each. All countries allow only equal number of diplomats, except as concession to friendly countries.
13. Canadian foreign minister requested for private talks. Says it would cause problems for canada if that many diplomats are removed.
14. Canadian PM requests for de-escalating.  <-- we are here now

&#x200B:

In geopolitics, to an outside observer this will look like either Canada overplayed its hand or was caught making unsubstantiated allegations. Both looks weak and unstable.

It seems his card was to threaten India saying he won't issue VISA anymore to Indians. But, when Indian govt was the first to make that move and called his bluff, he was unable to recover after that. Then when only Pakistan stood with Canada, it became embarrassing, and made it look like it was false accusations.",k3i3i5e,Reply,8,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/16zysnm/trudeau_rejects_retaliation_as_india_moves_to/k3jle6b/,None,

After all this it seems likely that Modi's thugs now know that they have to be more careful with communication and perhaps less brazen with international assassinations in the future.

""\[Canada\] contributes a negligible amount to climate change""

https://edgar.jrc.ec.europa.eu/report\_2022

China, US and India together contribute about \~52% of CO2 emissions.  That means the other countries produce \~48%.  So collectively other countries are also contributing significantly to climate change.

Canada is 11th in the world for emissions produce.  11 out of 195 countries (close to 95% percentile .  That's significant, especially because we rank 13th out of 195 countries per capita.

11th highest country out of 195 is a significant producer.

""China is doing nothing to reduce their emissions and will burn the planet""

China has a cap and trade system, pricing their carbon.  They have also begun to flatten their emission increases.

""China produces way more than us, so they should reduce emissions first.""

China has a lot more people too - over 20+ times as many.  Per person, Canadians emit 70% more.

So, you are saying our climate and country size is why we have large GHG emissions.  Let's look at the top emitters both per capita and gross.

[https://edgar.jrc.ec.europa.eu/report\_2022?vis=pop#emissions\_table](https://edgar.jrc.ec.europa.eu/report_2022?vis=pop#emissions_table)

So, the top countries per capita are countries like UAE, Kuwait, Trindad and Tobago, Brunei - are these big cold countries?  No, but a lot do have O&G  


Top emitting countries seem to be based on advanced economies and population - China, US, India.

I dont see any special geogrpaphy or densite dictating this.  


""The per-capita argument for Canada needing to lower our quality of life in the name of fairness is just a combination of naivety and virtue signalling.""

No, its based on cooperation.  Let's put it this way, if per capita didn't matter why should the federal government give the exact same funding to Ontario and PEI - after all, per capita doesn't matter.  


If you were Ontario in this case, do you think would be okay with this?  Do you think you would constructively participate?

And our emissions are not insignificant - in both per capita and gross we are around the 95% percentile of emitters.

Some of this I think have been done, but not enough imo. As much as we hate the idea of tax cuts and ""big business"" making money, I do think we need more companies to invest in this sector so we can naturally shift emissions to cleaner energy and research different alternatives. The carbon tax lowers economic output and increases costs along the entire supply chain, and these effects ultimately get pushed onto consumers. 

It'd be nice if crippling our own economy with the carbon tax set an example and caused other countries to follow, but we don't live in a vacuum and a lot of countries actively want to see western hegemony fall in their own self interest, so we're essentially just shooting ourselves in the foot here in their eyes. 

Part of the reason why sanctions on Russia for the war haven't been as effective as they could've been is cause they supply cheap oil and gas to countries that still needed them, like Europe and india, while Canada wasn't able to offer an alternative cause we basically killed our own oil and gas sector, despite being one of the most natural resource rich countries in the world.

How would that even work in a free trade world. The only thing that would keep the price low is when you have a competitor trying to acquire more business. Taxation hits every supplier equally which means at some point they dont feel like its worth it to operate anymore and you turn production from one country to any others. 

I couldn't give a rats ass where the product is made. If it is designed will, function exactly as it is designed to do. The average consumer doesnt give a rats ass about ethic. What we care about is the functionality, the price, the life span of the product and the craftsmanship.

What you fail to understand is that lalaland PoV only happens when you are a country of power. In both wealth ( spending power) and military. Where the companies are willing to cater to your demand because they want your business. They cant really afford to lose your business. Countries like China , India , USA , EU as a whole , Japan , South Korea. Canada? You get laugh out of the room. Look at international banks, look at anything specialized. Their NA office is always in both USA and Mexico. Rarely any in Canada. 

The thing you dont seem to understand is once you hit the monopoly status you have no other choice but to take it.

That was my question, though: is Canada a democracy? You seem to imply that I think ""of course yes"".

Are you really convinced that Canada 100% is a democracy? 

I mean, it's really not as if that's a clear-cut ""yes"". You may think so, but that's just a very simplistic view on the matter.

Look for instance at: [link](https://ourworldindata.org/democracy), where the ""democratic character"" of different countries around the world are measured. Canada scores high, yes, but not ""100%"" (as you appear to claim) - and even then it depends what metrics are used to measure this.

So it *really* isn't a silly question to ask. It is even a serious field of study.

Back to the topic: sure, India is far less democratic than Canada and most Western nations (and its democracy isn't doing great, but we can argue that about several countries with which Canada has strong relationships. But given that Canada needs allies worldwide, India looks like a much better choice in that region of the world than countries around it.
